# File Dump
Application to display the contents of a file in hexadecimal format.<br>
<br>
This is similar to the macOS/Linux bash command hexdump, but you can scroll up and down through the file, and change bytes. It is also coloured for easier spotting of values.<br>
<br>
You can also load in a second file to compare with the first, displaying the differences. Another feature is that you can XOR every byte in the entire file with a single value.<br>
<br>
The output of the hex dump can be output to a text file.<br>
<br>
The original two versions were written, on Windows, as I did not have anything suitable at the time. However, both these versions were 'rough and ready'. This version is compiled on Lazarus for Windows, macOS and Linux.<br>
