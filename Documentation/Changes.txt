V3.00
* Complete re-write and re-design from V2.15

V3.01
* Fixed a bug where the compared file is not positioned before reading a byte.
* Adjusted some of the control sizes to fit the font of the other platforms.
* Commented the source code.

V3.02
* Prevented resizing below a certain height, which otherwise crashed the application.
* Disabled the scroll bar when not in use, which would also crash the application.
* Extra checks when populating the grid to make sure there is something to populate it with.

V3.03
* Compare files was not working correctly. It was one byte ahead on the comparing file. This has been fixed.
* The application would crash when a file could not be opened. This now does not crash but reports to the user the fact.
* The files are opened non-exclusively (i.e. another application can open the file at the same time).
* Files can now be dragged and dropped onto the application to open them, closing any previously opened file.
* New button added to close the currently open file(s).
