V3.00
* Complete re-write and re-design from V2.15

V3.01
* Fixed a bug where the compared file is not positioned before reading a byte.
* Adjusted some of the control sizes to fit the font of the other platforms.
* Commented the source code.

V3.02
* Prevented resizing below a certain height, which otherwise crashed the application.
* Disabled the scroll bar when not in use, which would also crash the application.
* Extra checks when populating the grid to make sure there is something to populate it with.

V3.03
* Compare files was not working correctly. It was one byte ahead on the comparing file. This has been fixed.
* The application would crash when a file could not be opened. This now does not crash but reports to the user the fact.
* The files are opened non-exclusively (i.e. another application can open the file at the same time).
* Files can now be dragged and dropped onto the application to open them, closing any previously opened file.
* New button added to close the currently open file(s).

V3.04
* Progress Bar added to show progress when saving file as a text file.

V3.05
* Fixed a bug where the end of a file would not be displayed.

V3.06
* New higher resolution application icon

V3.07
* Bug still remained where the end of file wasn't being shown correctly.
* Cell hints now work, and show the ASCII character (if a printable character) or control character name (<32 or =127) if no file is being compared. If a file is being compared, the hex number of the compared file is displayed instead.
* Changed the background colour of the characters column.
* Application also checks automatically to see if a file has changed, and refreshes.
* Saving to a text file now opens the progress in a separate window with an Abort button.
* Re-arranged the toolbar.
* Added the ability to configure the colour scheme of the hex display.
* Added a search window and moved the 'Jump To' field there. The open file can now be searched for a string or a sequence of hex numbers.
* Can now scroll using the mouse wheel.
* Added higher res images for the buttons and made the application High-DPI aware.

V3.08
* Hints were getting shown for the first and last columns.
* The search box was not getting repainted correctly on the second, and subsequent, openings.
