V3.01
* Fixed a bug where the compared file is not positioned before reading a byte.
* Adjusted some of the control sizes to fit the font of the other platforms.
* Commented the source code.

V3.02
* Prevented resizing below a certain height, which otherwise crashed the application.
* Disabled the scroll bar when not in use, which would also crash the application.
* Extra checks when populating the grid to make sure there is something to populate it with.
